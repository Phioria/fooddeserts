This package contains data from the USDA about food deserts in the United States. A food desert, in this context is defined as being a census tract where a significant number (at least 500 people) or share (at least 33 percent) of the population is greater than one-half mile from the nearest supermarket, supercenter, or large grocery store for and urban area or greater than 10 miles for a rural area.
